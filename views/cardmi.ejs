                            <h2>Implementation</h2>
                            <p>CardMi is coded in Java using Android Studio. The structure of the app consists of the Flashcard and Flashcard Set, both of which are implemented as objects in Java.
                                Flashcard Set objects are named collections of Flashcard objects. Users can create Flashcard Sets and their component Flashcards, which are then serialized into
                                a string and stored on the user's device in an SQLite database. Flashcard Sets have separate lists of Flashcards that distinguish between terms that
                                have been marked as studied or deleted.
                            </p>  
                            <p>CardMi is available for download on the Google Play Store.</p>

                            <h2>Features</h2>
                            <p>CardMi provides a simple platform for users to create sets of flashcards for study. Flashcards can be marked as studied, recycled, sorted, or randomly shuffled 
                                to aid in the study process. The app supports two views of the flashcard set: the main view which displays cards one-by-one and allows the user to swipe between cards,
                                and a list view that provides an overview of all of the flashcards in the set.
