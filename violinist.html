                    <h1>Hire a Violinist in the Netherlands</h1>
                    <blockquote>5 star experience! I hired Michael to play solo violin to celebrate mine and my fianceâ€™s engagement! 
                        Not only was Michael a super talented musician, but also was beyond flexible, 
                        anticipated my wants/needs, and was super reliable and easy to get a hold of throughout the whole process. 
                        The engagement was a winner and in no uncertain terms did Michael add to the essence and wonder of the evening! 
                        Would book again in a second. Thanks Michael!!! - Evan S.

                    <p>I am a Philadelphia-based violinist who performs classical, popular, and anime music in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. 
                        If you would like to hire a violinist to perform in a wide variety of settings, including weddings, corporate events, holiday celebrations, 
                        private salon concerts, recitals, look no further! I constantly expand my repertoire to include new selections by continuously composing, 
                        arranging and recording music for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb46nljnneXaQCa5wKYsbWA">Youtube</a>, 
                        where I have reached over a million views.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My goal as a violinist is to contribute a tailored musical selection for every event. 
                        As a performer, composer, and arranger, I am able to meet the needs of a wide range of people. 
                        I would love to have the opportunity to collaborate with you in making your event a truly unforgettable experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Have a listen to some of my playing and feel free to keep reading to learn more!
