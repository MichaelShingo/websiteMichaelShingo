He quickly responded to my inquiry and sent over a detailed contract that made us so comfortable in trusting him to be our violinist for our wedding day. The event was a surprise, and Michael did a great job keeping it that way for us! :) He played a range from Frank Sinatra, to a song we requested from a personal favorite video game!!! If you are considering live music for your event, definitely put Michael at the top of your list!!!'},

So many guests were talking about the amazing music he played and it really brought our ceremony to the next level. Michael even came outside to play during our “bubble exit” and did such a wonderful job. Very talented!!'},

He was responsive, incredibly talented, and clearly passionate about his work. Michael was generous and accommodating, learning new songs at our request for the processional and recessional and playing outdoors in chilly conditions. The violin/cello duo\'s elegant performance left an impression on our guests, heightening the emotions of our day in a beautiful way. We will be forever thankful.'},

I had also asked him to play a few songs that were not on his usual play list and he learned them in a couple of weeks time and was flawless!!! The surprise and the joy and the excitement that he provided for this experience was the best gift I have ever given anyone! Michael was responsive, prompt and flexible with a rain date. Just an overall amazing experience!'},

They were friendly, polite and the hit of my dinner party. We had classical music lovers in attendance who were especially overjoyed. Michael played pieces that perfectly fit the vibe of my Victorian Halloween party. He even went over the top and took time to prepare a specially requested piece..'}
